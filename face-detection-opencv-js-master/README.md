# lazer's remote emotion detector

Uses JavaScript to send a webcam stream to a python script on my gaming desktop which uses its RTX 3060 to evaluate the sent image using a neural network.
A response is sent back containing which of the 7 emotions the model was trained to predict is most likely to be expressed by the person in the webcam.
